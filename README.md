Code for [A Dependency Syntactic Knowledge Augmented Interactive Architecture for End-to-End Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.01951)

## Introduction

The implementation is based on [IMN](https://github.com/ruidan/IMN-E2E-ABSA) and the dataset we used is also from IMN. The dependency tree is generated by [spaCy](https://spacy.io/). Download [Glove](http://nlp.stanford.edu/data/glove.840B.300d.zip) file and the bert-based feature used in this Repo is produced by [BERT](https://github.com/google-research/bert). The dependency tree (i.e., *.pkl) is generated by prepare_data_A.py and utils_opinion.py, most of the two files is borrowed from [this](https://github.com/JHart96/keras_gcn_sequence_labelling). 
## Usage

Training and evaluating with the following scripts (the Hyper-parameters are shown in 'train.py' file and you may change them for better results): 

```
bash train.sh
```

## Requirements

+ Python 2.7
+ Keras 2.2.4
+ tensorflow 1.4.1
